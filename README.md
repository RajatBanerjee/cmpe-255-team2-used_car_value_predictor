## Problem Statement
Prices of used cars has always been a topic of intrigue, since, unlike the New car market, the prices are not regulated. With the rise of new car prices, sales of used cars have gone up [1]. Therefore there is a need for a system that can determine the value and worthiness of the car using different attributes, which will benefit both buyers as well as sellers.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to ingest historical sales information of used cars and use Machine Learning and come up with a prediction model. 

This secondary objective is to build a web application that will take car attributes such as odometer value, car condition, etc as input and predict to a high degree of accuracy, what the value of the said vehicle should be.
